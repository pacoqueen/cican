The toolkit includes the tools record.py and playback.py these tools can be
used to "record" and "playback" GPS data. The playback includes a simple time
sync to attempt to maintain a accurate playback.

There is support for both serialport (includes most USB GPS's that use serial
emulation over USB) and tcpport datasources. Use the TCP port to access a
playback of a GPS data.
